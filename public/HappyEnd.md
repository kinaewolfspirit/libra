Happy End / Laineus feat. Hatsune Miku

If the Sound of Night Wind is the god's voice
I'm going to hear it until the sun comes up
Then I'll get a kind heart
And try to live for someone else

If the day I'll die is the end of the world
There's no one to be sad
And even if the day is tomorrow
Just something will sparkle once

The song I was listening when the sunset
it was singing fancy words

Even if the rain you make fall is tears
If it makes a rainbow on my heart
It's a Happy End with a cheerful tune
I'm contented even life like that

A girl who I once loved was crying
So I pretended I'm sad

The lyrics and sounds I love
Even a liar looked kind to me

Even if the rain you make fall is tears
If it makes a rainbow on my heart
It's a Happy End with a cheerful tune
I'm contented even life like that

Even if tomorrow is the end of the world
Please don't look so sad
